# Fullstack Assignment

This is a Next.js assignment that allows users to search localities and get their weather data from WeatherUnion API.
You can only view weather data of certain localities used in localitis.ts file which are sample data extracted from WeatherUnion API since I could'nt find any way to extract the locality_id of each locality being searched in the input of our application.
